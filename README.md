# Rice-Leaf-disease-detection

Rice disease has serious negative effects on crop yield, and the correct diagnosis of rice diseases is the key to avoid these effects. However, the existing disease diagnosis methods for rice are neither accurate nor efficient, and special equipment is often required.

Crop diseases can significantly reduce its yield and quality, which is a great threat to food supplies around the world. Thus, disease control is critical for rice production. The key for successful disease control is a correct and fast diagnosis of diseases, so that pesticide control measures can be applied timely. Currently, the most widely used method to diagnose rice crop diseases is manual judgment based on the appearance of diseases.
